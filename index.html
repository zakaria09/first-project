                    One of the greatest football coaches of his generation, we will explore how Jose Mourinhos leadership style and qualities have contributed towards his success.

            <p class="text-col">
                Many managers, coaches and team leaders confuse influence for authority. Why? Instilling your authority over someone is a short term solution which can lead to further conflict.

                For example Jose Mourinho could have said to Frank Lampard, as your manager I demand you to be the best in the world! This would have caused an increase in pressure, stress and possibly resulting in lower levels of performance.

                Instead Mourinho used the power of psychology by paying Lampard the ultimate compliment thus increasing his morale and making him feel like a world beater.

                As a team leader you have the ability to influence your staff both in a positive and negative manner which has a direct impact on their daily performance.

            <img class="pic-col" src="img/resiliance.jpg">
            <p class="text-col">
                Without resilience those in a position of power within any job role will fall short of their goals. So how can we channel our failures? Having the mantality to find the solution to the problem rather than stress as your first reaction will solve this!

                As a manager, coach or someone who holds authority, you will always come under scrutiny and be judged and criticised for your decision making skills. Therefore your mental skills must be equally on point in order to rise to the challenge.

            <p class="text-col">
                The Jose Mourinho philosophy is truly about unity and the mentality of us against them. This draws a clear distinction between what we represent and what our actions are to achieve our objectives. Very similar to Sir Alex Fergusons leadership style.

                Legendary Chelsea captain John Terry can attest to this more than most other players saying, he is a master motivator who unites us and makes us feel superior to the competition. By uniting his team and individually praising them, he is building their confidence at work and therefore increasing their chances of success.
